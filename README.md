## ❖ Introduction ❖

For this assignment, you’ll be writing a full-stack web app that does not require user input. You’ll implement a database (the model in the MVC framework), author a simple front-end (the view in the MVC framework), and author the PHP (the controller in the MVC framework) that will communicate between the front-end and the database.

Your final project should look exactly like `final-output.html`.

## ❖・Rules・❖

* Indent all code by whitespace only
* Indent PHP by 4 spaces
* Indent MySQL by 2 spaces
* All MySQL-related code/files must go in files ending in `.sql` and placed in the `database` folder
* The database should be stood up by via `setup.sql`
* Use the credentials already included in `database/setup.sql` for your database
* Ensure the credentials in `database/setup.sql` are also in `includes/config.php`
* Include an ER model of your database in the form of a JPG that is no larger than 1MB
* The output of your `index.php` file should look exactly as the file `final-output.html`
* Aside from `index.php`, all your PHP should be included in the `includes` folder
* Replace the contents of the included `er-model.jpg` with your ER model
* All the CSS your project requires is already in `css/style.css`
